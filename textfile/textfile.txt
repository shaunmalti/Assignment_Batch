Hidden Histories of Exploration: Researching the RGS-IBG Collections: This output is a multi-media exhibition, comprising four main elements: physical displays in the RGS Pavilion Gallery and Foyle Reading Room (15th October to 10th December 2009); a project website and online exhibition (2009-present); a companion volume and catalogue (published 2009); and a traveling exhibition available for hire from the RGS-IBG (2010-present). The output presents research on the collections of the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG), focused on the agency of indigenous peoples and intermediaries in the history of exploration. The portfolio of evidence submitted has three main parts: the project website and online exhibition (accessible at http://hiddenhistories.rgs.org); the companion volume and catalogue (Driver F and Jones L 2009. Hidden Histories of Exploration. Researching the RGS-IBG Collections, Royal Holloway, University of London in association with the Royal Geographical Society [with IBG], London. ISBN: 978-1-905846-30-6); and a peer-reviewed journal article reflecting on the physical exhibition (Driver F 2013 �Hidden histories made visible? Reflections on a geographical exhibition�, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, NS 38 (3), 420-435).

The main aims of the Newport Medieval Ship Project are to document, analyse and describe this 15th-century vessel, and its associated artifacts and environmental finds. This archive comprises data gathered on site and during the post-excavation analysis phase.The digital archive, comprising some 12,200 files (124 Gb) represents one of the largest datasets every deposited with the United Kingdom Archaeological Data Service. The archive is freely accessible to all at Archaeological Data Service Archive arch-1563-1. 
The Newport Medieval Ship, Wales, United Kingdom, 
The origins of some bishops� residences as castles in Scotland 
The volume contains the first and only critical edition of the text, which is preserved in a single medieval manuscript. It is accompanied by a modern English translation and by extensive textual and historical notes. The text is a major source for the history of the first Norman abbey in northern England, and thus for the reintroduction of monasticism to the North in the late eleventh century. It is therefore of considerable importance and deserves to be made available both to scholars and, through the translation, to a wider audience.
